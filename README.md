 Java Internship tasks.

Task:1

----Number Guessing Game----

**Description:**
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java application that allows players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Java's Swing library, making it easy for players to interact with the game. Players input their guesses, receive feedback on their guesses, and have the opportunity to play multiple rounds.

**Features:**
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of each round.
- Provides an intuitive GUI with prompts and input fields for player interactions.
- Gives feedback to players on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Limits the player to five attempts per round.
- Offers an option to play another round or exit the game after completing a round.
- Utilizes event-driven programming and Swing's components for smooth user interaction.

**Usage:**
1. Run the Java application.
2. The GUI welcomes the player and explains the game's rules.
3. Enter your guess into the input field and click the "Check" button.
4. Receive feedback on your guess and follow the prompts for further actions.
5. Play multiple rounds by choosing to play again or exit the game.

**Requirements:**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic familiarity with Java programming concepts and GUI development.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Compile and run the `NumberGameGUI.java` file using your preferred Java IDE or command line.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.


Enjoy the game and have fun guessing the numbers!


Task:2

-----ATM Machine---

**Description:**
The ATM Machine project is a simple Java program that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to interact with a virtual bank account through a text-based interface. Users can perform actions like checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. The project demonstrates basic concepts of Java programming, including class structures, user input handling, and conditional logic.

**Features:**
- Login or sign up to access the ATM features.
- Check account balance.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money from the account.
- Basic user interface for interacting with the ATM.

**Usage:**
1. Compile and run the `ATMmachine.java` file using a Java compiler or IDE.
2. Choose between login and sign up options.
3. If logging in, provide the account name and password.
4. Once logged in or signed up, follow the prompts to perform various ATM operations.
5. Exit the program when done.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Compile and run the `ATMmachine.java` file using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the virtual ATM.

Enjoy using the virtual ATM and exploring Java programming concepts!

Task: 3


----Student Management System-----

**Description:**
The Student Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage student records efficiently. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by allowing users to perform actions such as adding, removing, searching, and displaying student information. The application provides an intuitive text-based interface that interacts with the user, enabling easy management of student data.

**Features:**
- Add new students along with their first name, last name, roll number, grade, address, and phone number.
- Remove existing students by specifying their first name, last name, and roll number.
- Search for students based on their first name, last name, and roll number.
- Display a list of all registered students, along with their complete details.
- User-friendly interface that guides users through each operation.
- Utilizes a List data structure to store and manage student records.

**Usage:**
1. Compile and run the `StudentManagement.java` file using a Java compiler or IDE.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations on student records.
3. Add, remove, search, and display student information as needed.
4. Continue using the application until you decide to exit.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Compile and run the `StudentManagement.java` file using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage student records.

Task: 4
